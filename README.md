## About Pictochat

Created and maintained by me, [ljharnish](https://www.youtube.com/c/ljharnish), Pictochat is a chat platform that runs utilizing [Scaledrone](https://www.scaledrone.com/) for (close to) real-time messaging.

## Update 2.0 Patch Notes:
```diff
Pictochat has had an entire redesign.
There are LOADS of new features, so let's list them all!

Additions:
+ Themes: Light, Dark, AMOLED (SUPER DARK), Red, Green, Blue
+ Images: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp, even Base64 encoded images (of those formats) work! (ONLY USABLE BY LINKED IMAGES EXCEPT Base64)
+ TAGS: Every user will have a randomly generated tag, so if users have the same name, you can tell the difference!
+ Notifications: Check your tab icon for any missed messages!
+ Blacklisted Words: Some words are blacklisted. Messages with these words cannot be sent, and names with these words will change to randomly generated ones.
+ New way to change names: Change name by clicking Settings, type your desired name into the text box, and click "Change Name."

Removals:
- Multiple chat rooms: Only one chat room is available as of this update.
